  "story": "the paternal grandmother messages Father from the southern part of the country; his parents both speak different dialects and his mother prefers hers over speaking in a common tongue. Software translation saves Father from the sometimes awkward 1:1 encounters he has had with grandmother. He is gratified that he doesn’t have to remind her yet again that he never learned that dialect."
